# Rate Stevens - CS 546 Final Project
*By Austin Rocha, Faris Ibrahim, Oscar Tavara, and Tarik Kdiry*
Rate Stevens is a website which allows students that attend Stevens Institute of Technology to rate their courses and see the reviews of their fellow peers.
## Before Installing
Please make sure you have downloaded and installed MongoDB, NodeJS and npm to your computer.
If you have not, follow the links below to install them first:
* [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
* [NodeJS and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

You can verify that you have everything installed correctly by asking what version they are on. If you get a response that means it has been installed successfully. If you get a response that the "command is not found" then it was unsuccessful. Below is how to call the version for each program.
```bash
mongo -version
node -v
npm -v
```
## Installation
Installing is easy. You will first want to git clone this folder to your local computer. So navigate to the directory where you want this folder to be located and then run the bash code below.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FKnight9/finalCS546.git
```
Great! Now that we have npm installed it is really simple to get everything up and running. All you have to run is two lines!
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
That's it! The program should have run in your console and you should see a link available to click that will open up the webpage in your browser.
